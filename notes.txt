1st thing is to get the board set up and to spawn tetros above the board 
then make them fall
then see if they fun into something
then add movement


For the ghost tetromino: 
    
    first, get the location of the current tetro, 

    second, see how far we can go down,

    third, add those coordinates the a ghost tetro variable in the game struct,

    fourth, display those on the board,

    * to display them on the board we will simply see when the coord we're on when we're displaying the boards pixels, is in the ghost pieces coords
